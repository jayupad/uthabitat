            "question": "Does UT Habitat have dues?",
            "answer": "Yes. Members joining in the Fall Semester can either pay $50 for the entire year or $35 for the Fall (and the remaining $15 in the Spring Semester). Members joining in the Spring Semester must pay $35 for the semester. We understand that college is expensive. If dues are a concern, we encourage prospective members/current members to talk to our Treasurer at the beginning of the semester to arrange an alternative option. Nobody will be denied participation in UT Habitat due to financial obligations being too large a burden."

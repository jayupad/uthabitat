Members joining in the Fall Semester can either pay $50 for the entire year or $35 for the Fall (and the remaining $15 in the Spring Semester).

If dues are a concern, we encourage prospective members/current members to talk to our Treasurer at the beginning of the semester to arrange an alternative option.
